# Why we need Podcasting 2.0

The mission of Podcasting 2.0 and the Podcast Index is to preserve,
protect, and extend the open, independent podcasting ecosystem.

We do this by providing podcasters with new features for their shows,
equipping developers with new tools for their apps and services,
and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;improving the podcast experience for audiences.

Together, we will grow podcasting to a platform of value-exchange that includes developers with podcasters and audiences.
