# How to Add Transcripts to Your Podcast

_Powered by `<podcast:transcript>{:xml}`_

Podcasting 2.0 transcripts require two parts: a transcript file (one per language for each episode) and the `<podcast:transcript>` tag in the episode in your RSS feed.

1. **Create and edit a transcript file for your podcast episode(s)**. SRT or VTT are the best file formats for this. These are easiest to produce with a transcription service or AI-powered app. (See below for tools.)

2. **Upload the transcript file** to your podcast-hosting provider or a file-hosting service (preferrably a CDN). Make sure the file is publicly accessible.

3. **Add the URL for your transcript file** to your episode's transcript field, or in the `<podcast:transcript>` tag in your RSS feed. (Skip this step if your podcast-hosting provider does this for you.)

4. **Publish your episode!**
