# How to use the funding tag

_Powered by [`<podcast:funding>`](/tags/funding)_

The funding tag is really simple - a URL that links to a web-page that helps support a show; and some text that may appear in a podcast app. That's it.

In this example, this is a simple link to an open, one-off, payment to Podnews, to use a credit card. You can set these links up using Stripe.

```xml
<podcast:funding
 url="https://buy.stripe.com/4gw8zIcpc58CcGQ6ot"
>
Support us
</podcast:funding>
```

You could also use a URL to a [PayPal page](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/amazinglybrilliant), or to a subscription tool like Supporting Cast or others.

The tag is supported by many podcast apps and directories, including the popular Pocket Casts app, as well as Podcast Addict and AntennaPod, two of the largest Android apps.

It's also supported by most large podcast hosts, including Buzzsprout, RSS.com, Powerpress by Blubrry, and Transistor.

## Examples

Supporting Cast has written [a blog post about how to use the funding tag to link to subscription services like theirs.](https://www.supportingcast.fm/post/rss-funding-tag) In it, they note that NPR now supports the funding tag throughout their catalogue.
