# How to Use the TXT tag

_Powered by [`<podcast:txt>`](/tags/txt)_

The TXT tag is a versitle tag that can hold any kind of text. This is ideal for any kind of ownership verification an app or service might require. For example, transferring ownership of a podcast from one Apple account to another, or claiming your podcast on a new platform.

You can put _any_ text between `<podcast:txt>{:xml}` and `</podcast:txt>{:xml}`.

1. **Copy the special text** you are given by the app or service you are trying to use.

2. **Paste the special text into your publishing tool's TXT field** or manually insert it into the code, like `<podcast:txt>SPECIAL_TEXT_HERE</podcast:txt>{:xml}`

3. **Enter the "purpose" if necessary** either in your publishing tool or update your code like this `<podcast:txt purpose="PURPOSE_HERE">SPECIAL_TEXT_HERE</podcast:txt>{:xml}`

4. **Save your changes or paste the code** before the first `<item>{:xml}` in your RSS feed.
