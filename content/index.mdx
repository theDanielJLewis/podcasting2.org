## What does Podcasting 2.0 offer?

Podcasting 2.0 is a set of new features and standards that make podcasting better for everyone.

Podcasting 2.0 extends the RSS standard - the core technology that makes podcasting possible - to add new features. None of these features break any existing podcast feeds or podcast players, but, where supported, they enable podcasters to do more things, and enhance the experience for the audience.

Some of these new features, like [recommendations for other podcasts your audience might like](/podcast-namespace/tags/podroll), can be added to podcast feeds simply by adding the appropriate RSS tags. Many publishing tools and hosting providers make this as simple as filling in additional field.

Other features, like [accepting messages and payments from your audience as they listen](/podcast-namespace/tags/value), require additional tools and a few more initial steps.

## Where does Podcasting 2.0 work?

Podcasting 2.0 already has various levels of support from [independent modern podcast apps to Apple Podcasts](/apps)!

To take advantage of Podcasting 2.0 today, [check which features your hosting provider or publishing tool supports](/publishing-tools), or consider switching to one of these providers or tools.

## How to upgrade to Podcasting 2.0

Getting the most from Podcasting 2.0 can be summed up with these two steps:

1. Start implementing the Podcasting 2.0 features in your own podcast. [Visit our guides for help](/guides).
2. Encourage your audience to [try a better podcast app from Podcasting2.org/apps](/apps).
