# Podcasting 2.0 is for podcasters!

Podcasts deserve an open, independent podcasting ecosystem.
Podcasting 2.0 was created to preserve, protect, and extend
that ecosystem.

## Upgrade to the Podcast Namespace

Every good podcast starts with an RSS feed - the foundation for open podcasting.
But, open podcast feeds have lacked innovation for years: much of the innovation
that podcasting has seen recently has been from large corporations building new
tools for their enclosed ecosystems - which don't benefit open podcasting, and
make it harder for podcasters to get the best for their listeners on all platforms.

Podcasting 2.0 changes that by finally bringing fresh innovation to
podcasting's core technology of RSS. RSS has always been able to be extended
to add new features; and through a new namespace - a set of standard features for
RSS - we can bring multiple benefits for audiences, podcasters, and developers.

### Podcast Namespace benefits

- Add transcripts that the creator controls, adding accessibility for all
- Add and edit interactive chaptersâ€”_without_ re-uploading your media file
- Earn money directly from your audience
- Engage through comments accessible accross multiple apps
- Expose more information about your podcast, like people, location, and more
- Lock your podcast against theft
- Notify your audience when you're live-streaming
- Deliver new episodes more quickly to your podcast followers
- Protect your podcast from censorship and deplatforming

## How to get started

1. Ensure your podcast is in the Podcast Index, and [add your podcast if it's not included](https://podcastindex.org/add).

2. Check with your podcast-feed-publishing tool for support of the Podcasting 2.0 features from the [new Podcast Namespace](/podcast-namespace). You might even want to switch providers in order to get the new features.

3. Prepare your podcast to receive streaming Bitcoin/Satoshis and Boostagrams through "Value 4 Value." [Here's a guide](https://value4value.info/).

4. Encourage your audience to [get a better podcast app](/apps) - or promote the one you like best.

## Who's in already?

A ton of podcasts are using these features already. Millions of podcast episodes already have transcripts.
More than half a million episodes are using super-chapters. [See the statistics from Livewire](https://livewire.io/podcast-index-stats-visualized/) and [dig into the trends](https://griddlecakes.com/nstrends/).
