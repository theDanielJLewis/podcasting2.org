          Podcasts deserve an open, independent podcasting ecosystem. 
          Podcasting 2.0 was created to preserve, protect, and extend
          that ecosystem.

      <h2>Upgrade to the Podcast Namespace</h2>
      <p>
        Every good podcast starts with an RSS feed - the foundation for open podcasting.
        But, open podcast feeds have lacked innovation for years: much of the innovation
        that podcasting has seen recently has been from large corporations building new
        tools for their enclosed ecosystems - which don&rsquo;t benefit open podcasting, and
        make it harder for podcasters to get the best for their listeners on all platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Podcasting 2.0 changes that by finally bringing fresh innovation to
        podcasting&rsquo;s core technology of RSS. RSS has always been able to be extended
        to add new features; and through a new namespace - a set of standard features for
        RSS - we can bring multiple benefits for audiences, podcasters, and developers.
