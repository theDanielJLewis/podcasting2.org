JSON chapter information also allows chapters to be displayed by a wider range of playback tools, including web browsers (which typically have no access to ID3 tags), thus greatly simplifying chapter support; and images can be retrieved on playback, rather than bloating the filesize of the audio.

Tools like [this one](https://www.uuidtools.com/v5) can help generate these values by hand. Or, language libraries like [this one](https://github.com/sporkmonger/uuidtools) in Ruby are widely available. Specifically for podcasts, [this tool from RSS Blue](https://tools.rssblue.com/podcast-guid) can help generate a GUID by hand.\n\nA podcast gets assigned a podcast:guid once in its lifetime using its current feed url (at the time of assignment) as the seed value. That GUID is then meant to follow the podcast from then on, for the duration of its life, even if the feed url changes. This means that when a podcast moves from one hosting platform to another, its podcast:guid should be discovered by the new host and imported into the new platform for inclusion into the feed.\n\nUsing this pattern, podcasts can maintain a consistent identity across the open RSS ecosystem without a central authority.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- All podcasts in the Podcast Index have already been assigned a GUID; but if one exists in the RSS feed, that value is canonical.\n- You can programmatically spot a GUID: it is 36 characters long, and contains four hyphen characters.\n- Be aware that Amazon Music also uses separate UUIDv5 identifiers within their podcast directory, which are calculated differently and unrelated to this specification.\n- The following regular expression (regex) will match a GUID `[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\\-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\\-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\\-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\\-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}`"

It takes the same format as a standard `<item>` episode tag, and all tags that are allowed as children of a normal `<item>` are also allowed as children of `<podcast:liveItem>`. Note that \"allowed\" is not the same as \"supported\". So, just like a normal `<item>`, you cannot depend on all apps to support all tags within `<podcast:liveItem>`, especially when the function of the tag is not obvious. For instance, including an `<itunes:duration>` tag in a live item is probably a waste of time since apps will not know what to do with that value in the context of live media.\n\nThis tag will also make use of the [podping](https://podping.cloud) notification network. A podping notification SHOULD be sent out by the host when the live stream starts, to let apps know."

    "nodeValue": "All tags that are valid as children of a standard `<item>` tag are also valid as children here.\n\nWhen specifying the audio/video source, the [`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`](#alternate-enclosure) tag is highly encouraged since it gives the broadest coverage of possible stream types and is explicit in it's communication of what transport protocol and media codecs are being used. In addition to [`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`](#alternate-enclosure), a standard [`<enclosure>`](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt) should also be given as a fallback to support podcast apps that don't yet implement [`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`](#alternate-enclosure).\n\nRegardless of which enclosure tag is used, feed owners must be conscious of the fact that choosing a non-mainstream streaming protocol/codec will limit the number of apps that can play the content. For that reason, it's highly recommended to use only the two most widely supported protocols (mp3 and mp4/h.264) to ensure compatibility with the broadest number of apps on various platforms. Choosing a streaming format that is outside of this narrow list might exclude many apps from playing your content. As broader adoption of HLS, Opus, etc. becomes apparent, this recommendation will change to include newer formats.\n\nThe [`<podcast:contentLink>`](#content-link) tag is also required to be present, to ensure that listeners have a fallback option in case their chosen app cannot play the given content stream directly. In most instances this will just be a link to an HTML page that can play the live stream. Such a page can reside on the podcaster's own website, a page provided by their hosting company or a third party platform they have chosen to use. Podcasters who live stream to multiple platforms at once can also use the [`<podcast:contentLink>`](#content-link) tag to provide links to those other platforms.\n\nA robust, well-written `<podcast:liveItem>` tag will include all three of: [`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`](#alternate-enclosure), [`<enclosure>`](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt) and [`<podcast:contentLink>`](#content-link) to ensure the broadest interopability with podcast apps.\n\nThe function of `<guid>` within a live item tag is the same as it is within a regular item.
